# Analytical CRM Simulation Project

>_This repository is being continually updated as the project progresses._

<br>

**This project is aimed at building an analytical CRM web-application utilising insights gained from Machine Learning.**
<br></br>
## Use Cases and Objectives

There are two use-cases which will be analysed based on customer behaviour: **churn** and **cross-sell / up-sell**.

**The holistic aims of the project include:**
- Analysing appropriate datasets fitting the use cases described above;
- Building, training, validating, and testing ML models in order to attain the best possible metrics selected for each use-case;
- Using ML-model output and data as content for a CRM web-application built using Django;
- Populating the web-app with dashboards based on data in order to simulate a real CRM system;
- Hosting the web-app as to simulate an independent service.

## Update


This project currently contains the data and Jupyter Notebook for the churn use case. Originally inspired by the `Telco Churn` project in the [Bootcamp directory](https://github.com/an-sla/BootcampProjects), this analysis is based on a new enriched Telco Churn dataset by IBM, made available via Kaggle. The client is a Telecommunications company in the USA, and its clients use mobile and internet services. The business problem involves predicting whether they will churn, i.e., leave the company.

Currently, an extensive EDA section has been completed, and ML-model application is in progress: metrics and models have been determined and the ML pipeline has been built.

### Getting Started

The `.ipynb` file with the preliminary analysis (EDA) and ML pipeline is stored in the `/EnrichedTelco` directory. The data is composed of 5 tables in the `.xlsx` format, which are stored in the `/EnrichedTelco/data_archive` sub-directory. Table and data descriptions are available in the Jupyter Notebook.
